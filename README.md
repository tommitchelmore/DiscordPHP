# DiscordPHP

## Overview

Simple API Wrapper for Discord - intended for use on small webapps that need some basic integration.  This does *not* run as a process with 'onMessage' events or anything similar.  I would recommend [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/#/) or [Java Discord Api](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) for that functionality.

## Features

* Get guild name and icon from its ID
* Get a guild member and their relevant user data
* Convert icon/avatar hashes into `cdn.discord.com` urls
* Powerful rich embed generation class
* Send messages or rich embeds to specific text channels
* Built-in gateway identify function to allow a bot user to send messages

## Installation

Preferred installation is using composer
```
composer require tommitchelmore/discordphp
```

## Documentation

Urgh, I'll get round to it soon, I promise

## Contribution

I don't have plans to officially extent this beyond here as it's very much built for a specific project.  That said, if you wish to extent or modify it please feel free - the only condition is that you have to let me know if you make something cool!  (Equally, pull requests are open; I'd be delighted to accept code from someone better at this than me)
